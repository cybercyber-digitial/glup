This tracker is for bug reports only.


Before opening an issue, please make sure you've checked the following:

- For support requests, please use Stack Overflow (stackoverflow.com) or Gitter (see the README).

- If the bug is in a plugin, open an issue on the plugin repository, not the glup repository.

- If you're getting a deprecated module warning, don't worry about it: we're aware of it and it's not an issue. To make it go away, update to glup 4.0.

- If you're asking about the status of glup 4, please don't! You can see the remaining issues on the glup4 label: https://github.com/glupjs/glup/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Aglup4

**What were you expecting to happen?**

**What actually happened?**

**Please post a sample of your glupfile (preferably reduced to just the bit that's not working)**

```js
glup.task(function () {});
```

**What version of glup are you using?**

**What versions of npm and node are you using?**
